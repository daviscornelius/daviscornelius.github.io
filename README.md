"# scropplesite" 

Welcome to scropplesite!
**This is a private repo because the games are all copyrighted!**
Because of this, this repo will be private. The actual website will only be avaliable on a YubiKey, so don't even try.
"# 🚀 Running locally"
<hr>
Running scropplesite locally is easy!
First, you must have NodeJS and NPM installed.

Next, clone the repo.

```
git clone https://github.com/CodeMonster240/Burchweb-Games
```
Open the terminal for the repo, preferably with VSCode's terminal.

Then install the NPM http server:

```
npm i -g http-server
```

**If it says something about a security error, type the following command:**

```
cmd
```
Yeah, that was easy.

Run the http server now:

```
http-server
```

It should open in port `8080`. If it doesn't, that's okay still.

**DO NOT PUSH IT TO GITHUB PAGES OR YOU'LL GET SUED!!!!!**
